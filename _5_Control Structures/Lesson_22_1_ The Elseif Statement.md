## The Elseif Statement

Use the if...elseif...else statement to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

# Syntax:

if (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} elseif (condition) {
  code to be executed if condition is true;
} else {
   code to be executed if condition is false;
}

# Warning
- You can add as many elseif statements as you want. Just note, that the elseif statement must begin with an if statement.
