## Functions

A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.
A function will not execute immediately when a page loads. It will be executed by a call to the function.
A user defined function declaration starts with the word function:

function functionName() {    
   //code to be executed
}

A function name can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number or a special symbol.

# Note
Function names are NOT case-sensitive.

---------------------------------------------------------
# Which of the following is a correct name for a function?
- _hello()

---------------------------------------------------------

# In the example below, we create the function sayHello(). The opening curly brace ({) indicates that this is the beginning of the function code, while the closing curly brace (}) indicates that this is the end.
- To call the function, just write its name:

<?php

function sayHello() {
    echo "Hello!";
}

sayHello(); //call the function
?>

---------------------------------------------------------
# Drag and drop from the options below to create a function called myFunc and then call it:

function myFunc()  {
   echo "PHP is awesome!";
}

myFunc();
