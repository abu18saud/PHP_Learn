### meaing # Question ---- ## Point

---------------------------------------------------------
## Rules for PHP variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
- Variable names are case-sensitive ($name and $NAME would be two different variables)
---------------------------------------------------------
## Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
---------------------------------------------------------
# Fill in the blanks to declare the variables $name and $age and assign their values.
<?php 
    $name ="David";
    $age = 25;
?>
